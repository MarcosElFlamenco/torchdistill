# ***legacy/***
The configurations in `legacy/` are designed for torchdistill <= v0.3.3 with torchvision =< v0.13.1.

# ***official/***
The results obtained with the configurations in `official/` are confirmed and reported in papers, 
thus you could use them and refer to the results as baselines in your study.

# ***sample/***
Most of the configurations in `sample/` should be used for debugging or as starter configs to design your experiments.
If you use the methods as baselines, you **SHOULD** tune the hyperparameters in the configuration for a fair comparison.
